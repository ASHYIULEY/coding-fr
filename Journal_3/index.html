            As a self-proclaimed non-STEM person, coding was always really intimidating. So, taking this class was a huge personal achievement and an attempt at stepping out of my comfort zone. The mode of teaching made coding extremely approachable, and created a new medium for me to communicate my creativity...
            
            <br><br>Though I think I've deluded myself into thinking I can create basic code without following along with Prof. Belen. I'm humbled every Wednesday night as I go about creating a new project.

            I think one thing I underestimated was the approachability of coding. Though complicated, going through different exercises, journals, projects, and peer work really widened my "vocabulary" for web design–it became more of a puzzle than a blank canvas. 

            <br><br> In that breath, I became a more cognizant browser of web pages and social platforms. Working in social media now, I found myself questioning the purpose of certain navigation choices and visual design for brands. The class really gave me another way to think about being a consumer, and how products are marketed simply by the platform they are presented on.

           I won't continue coding for real any time soon simply because I think I'd spend more time punching my laptop screen than creating functioning code. However, I do think the literal act of coding is a great practice of critical thinking, attention to detail, and formulaic applications which I might consider engaging in more.

            For the class–we did it! The energy here has been the embodiment of a learning attitude, which has encouraged me throughout the course of the semester. Thank you Professor Belen for facilitating that environment.

            I believe our work comes from the inspiration we take from within ourselves and those around us, so y'all deserve your flowers too.
